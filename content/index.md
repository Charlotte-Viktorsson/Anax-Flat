I am DJ ArtIst, playing on European festival arenas and loves the art of music and cool lighting.
I play on festivals, clubs, events...  and more!

Since childhood, music is the most important, and it still is what makes me happy. What makes you happy?

Music is around me at all time, when I eat, when I go to sleep, when I wake up and most of all... when I work.

Hope you will help me living my dream!

Love,

DJ ArtIst
